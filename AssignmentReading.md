Q1. In what order should you perform the actions to create shared memory? (HINT: A minimum of three functions must be used the first time you create shared memory.)

Q2. What is the return type of mmap, and what can you do with it? (If you are unfamiliar with C/C++, you might need to do some personal research in order to understand this data type.)

Q3. What does fork() return, and how can that information be used?

Q4. If exec works as intended, what happens to the process that calls it?

Q5. Do all three functions for shared memory need to be called in every single process after the first? If yes, why? If no, which ones are needed, and why would you not need to call all of them?

Q6. What does a struct look like in memory, and if I store a struct in shared memory, how do I access its various fields?

Q7. How do I determine the size of a struct in bytes?
